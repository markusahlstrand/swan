## ü¶¢ Swan (Service web api notation)

**Swan** is a comprehensive, open-source toolset dedicated to defining, documenting, and enhancing the developer experience for **Service web api notation**.

It provides a standardized, human-readable format for describing your web services and integrates seamlessly with AI and VS Code to accelerate the development lifecycle.

### ‚ú® Key Features

- **AI-Powered Spec Generation:** Use natural language prompts to instantly generate detailed Swan notation specifications directly within VS Code.
- **Markdown Compatibility:** Specs are written in standard Markdown files (`.md`) for maximum editor compatibility and rendering.
- **Integrated Tooling:** Seamless experience with a dedicated VS Code extension for syntax highlighting, validation, and powerful actions.
- **Code Implementation:** Request the VS Code plugin to scaffold and implement your service based on the Swan spec, specifying tech stacks and deployment targets.
- **Documentation Hub:** The definitive source for the Swan notation specification, guides, and tooling.

### üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Development
pnpm vitepress dev     # Start docs site (localhost:5173)
pnpm vscode dev        # Watch VS Code extension
pnpm dev               # Start everything

# Building
pnpm vitepress build   # Build docs for production
pnpm vscode package    # Package VS Code extension
pnpm build             # Build everything
```

### üöÄ Quick Start: End-User Workflow

The primary way to use Swan is through our powerful **VS Code Extension**, which uses AI to guide you from a simple concept to a deployed service.

#### 1. Generate the Swan Specification

Start by using the VS Code extension's prompt interface (or an LLM) to describe your service in natural language and ask it to generate the Swan spec.

**Prompt Example:**

> "Create a spec for a simple microservice that handles user authentication, including sign-up, login, and password reset endpoints. Use the Swan notation as defined in **`swan.ahlstrand.es/swan.md`**."

#### 2. Review and Refine the Spec

The generated Swan spec will now appear in your workspace as a **Markdown file** (e.g., `auth.md`). This step is crucial to ensure the notation correctly and precisely describes your project's requirements, data models, and API contracts.

**Action:** _Review the generated **Markdown file**. Make any necessary adjustments to finalize your service contract._

#### 3. Implement the Service

Once the spec is finalized, you can leverage the VS Code plugin to scaffold the actual service implementation.

**Implementation Request Example:**

> "Implement this service using **Node.js/Express** with a **MongoDB** database, and configure it for deployment to **AWS Lambda**."

The extension will scaffold the project structure, boilerplate code, and configuration files based on your finalized spec and desired stack.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Development Setup (For Contributors)

This project is organized as a monorepo managed by **pnpm**. Below are the instructions for setting up your local environment to contribute to the tooling or documentation.

#### Monorepo Structure

```

swan/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ swan/               \# VitePress documentation site
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vscode-plugin/      \# VS Code extension
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json            \# Root package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pnpm-workspace.yaml     \# pnpm workspace configuration

```

#### Prerequisites

- **Node.js v18** or higher
- **pnpm v8** or higher
- **Git**

#### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd swan
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

#### Development Commands

Use the root level scripts or the project-specific filter commands to manage the workspace.

| Command           | Description                                                              |

#### Building and Publishing

##### Documentation Site (`apps/swan`)

To build for production:

```bash
pnpm --filter swan build
```

The built site will be in `apps/swan/docs/.vitepress/dist/`. Deploy this directory to your hosting provider (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, etc.).

##### VS Code Extension (`packages/vscode-plugin`)

To create the installable package:

```bash
pnpm --filter vscode-plugin package
```

This creates a `.vsix` file. To publish to the VS Code Marketplace, use the following (ensure you have the necessary credentials):

```bash
pnpm --filter vscode-plugin vsce publish
```
