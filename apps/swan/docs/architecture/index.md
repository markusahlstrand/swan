# Service Architecture

Building robust, maintainable, and scalable services requires careful consideration of multiple architectural concerns. This section covers the essential aspects of modern service architecture that Swan helps you implement correctly from the start.

## Core Principles

### 1. API-First Design

Design your API contract before implementation to ensure consistency and enable parallel development.

- **OpenAPI Specification**: Document your API using industry standards
- **Contract Testing**: Validate implementations against the specification
- **Client Generation**: Automatically generate SDKs and documentation

### 2. Observability by Design

Build monitoring, logging, and tracing into your services from day one.

- **Health Checks**: Automated service health monitoring
- **Structured Logging**: Consistent, searchable log formats
- **Distributed Tracing**: Track requests across service boundaries
- **Metrics Collection**: Monitor performance and business metrics

### 3. Security First

Implement security measures as foundational elements, not afterthoughts.

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure access control
- **Input Validation**: Protect against malicious inputs
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and ensure fair usage
- **Secure Communication**: TLS/SSL for all communications

## Architecture Components

| Component                                    | Purpose                                       | Swan Implementation          |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| [API Versioning](/architecture/versioning)   | Manage API evolution without breaking clients | Built-in semantic versioning |
| [Authentication](/architecture/auth)         | Secure service access and user management     | Pluggable auth providers     |
| [OpenAPI Integration](/architecture/openapi) | API documentation and tooling                 | Automatic spec generation    |
| [Monitoring](/architecture/monitoring)       | Service health and performance tracking       | Integrated observability     |
| [Error Handling](/architecture/errors)       | Consistent error responses and recovery       | Standardized error formats   |
| [Configuration](/architecture/config)        | Environment-specific service settings         | Type-safe configuration      |
